        <!-- Positioning elements allows you to control where elements are placed on the page -->
        
        <!-- There are 4 main types of positioning: -->
        <!-- Static -- default setting; elements are positioned in the normal flow of the page -->
        <!-- Relative -- elements are positioned relative to their normal position -->
        <!-- Absolute -- elements are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor -->
        <!-- Fixed -- elements are positioned relative to the browser window -->

        <!-- FROM THE NOTES -->
        <!--
            Static -- default positioning; follows normal document flow
            Relative -- positions an element relative to its normal position
            Absolute -- positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor; takes an element out of its normal flow of the page and positions it precisely where you want it, regardless of other elements
            Fixed -- locks an element to a specific location, making it visible even as the page scrolls
            Sticky -- mix between the relative and fixed positions. Originally treated as relative until a specific point is met, then it will be treated as fixed.
